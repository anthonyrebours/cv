intro;I am a young historian of economics. My research focuses on the structuring of economics as a scientific discipline and its relationships with other social sciences, notably geography and planning sciences, after 1945. Through these topics, I am led to explore the works of various disciplines that have influenced the research of economists interested in spatial issues. I also rely a lot on quantitative tools dedicated to the study of sciences (bibliometrics techniques and network analysis).
